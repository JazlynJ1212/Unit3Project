### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in lab did help, including the search bar/form and how to fetch from the API. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would add more CSS formatting. I would have a heading that says "Now Playing" and "Search" at the appropriate times.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The difficulty implementing some of the features did not go as planned. I noticed my peers had gif header backgrounds that I would like to try next time.

### Open-source libraries used
